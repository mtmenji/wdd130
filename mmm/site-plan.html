    <p class="bold">Personal Finance and Budget Definitions</p>
    <p>
      According to Investopedia:
      Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses
      budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often
      refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them
      about financial and investment opportunities.
      Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how
      you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially
      savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Investopedia:
      A budget is an estimation of revenue and expenses over a specified future period of time and is usually compiled and re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Budgets can be made for a person, a group of people, a business, a government, or just about anything else that makes and spends money.
      To manage your monthly expenses, prepare forz life's unpredictable events, and be able to afford big-ticket items without going into debt, budgeting is important. Keeping track of how much you earn and spend doesn't have to be drudgery, doesn't require you to be good at math, and doesn't mean you can't buy the things you want. It just means that you'll know where your money goes, you'll have greater control over your finances.

    <p class="bold">Financial Gurus</p>
    <p>
      These are my favorite finance "gurus". I believe all share great insights, but from my personal experience from following them I will categorize them as follows.

      Dave Ramsey - For beginners who are already struggling with big debts and those wanting to follow a very conservative approach to their finances.

      The Money Guy Show with Brian Preston and Bo Hanson - For those who want to have a mixed portfolio of being conservative but also dabbling into investing to set yourself for the future.

      Graham Stephen - For those who want to understand the risks (AND BENEFITS) of investing and are okay with making some riskier decisions that involve a lot of hard work.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">Important Note</p>
    <p>
      My number one personal revelation when it comes to personal finances:
      If you're low on money, there's only two options:
      Increase Income or Decrease Expenses
    </p>
    <p class="bold">Steps to Creating a Budget</p>
    <p>
        First, define what your income is. My personal tip: A lot of people will estimate what their income will be at the beginning of the month and budget accordingly, however that's just an estimate. When I budget, I want to know exact dollar amounts. Here's what you should do instead -- plan your budget according to the income you earned in the previous month.
          Note: This takes some planning in advance because if you need your income from that month to cover current expense, then the first big move is to SAVE SAVE SAVE!
      
        Second, subtract all fixed expenses from income: mortgage/rent, PMI/renters insurance, health insurance, vehicle payments, car insurance, phone bill, and utilities (electricity, water, gas, sewer, internet, trash collection). Side note: I would consider cable tv more as a subscription versus a necessary bill.
    
        Third: Invest in yourself. Put money into savings and investments.
          Deductibles: The Money Guy show teaches to make sure your deductibles are covered first and foremost. This includes health insurance, car insurance, and home insurance. If something major happens, then you can rest assured that you can cover the maximum of what you'll need to pay. 
      
          Savings: Besides deductibles, it's also good to have an emergency fund. Generally, this is going to be about 3-6 months of income. However, another rule of thumb is to have enough months of savings based on how quickly you think you'd be able to find a new job.
      
          Savings: Consider saving up for that new car versus getting yourself into debt! Especially if you have reliable transportation already. Think of it as pre-paying yourself until you can afford to buy a car in full.
      
          Investment: I'm not going to get myself in trouble here by sharing investment strategies while not having the expertise, but what I CAN do is refer you to one of the three references made above. I wholeheartedly support all of these guys!
          NOTE: Sometimes, if money is tight, then obviously skip this step and proceed to the fourth step. Whatever money can be saved after step four should be placed back into investing in yourself.
    
        Fourth: With the remaining amount, allocate the rest of your funds into the following categories, normally in this order:
          1. Tithing (for those religious folk out there, including myself!)
            a. As a faithful Christian I have been blessed by paying my tithing! I'm so happy to support those around my community and around the world as I trust church leaders to apply that money to benefitting those who need help. Click on the button here to learn more about tithing!
          2. Groceries
          3. Gas/Travel Expenses
          4. Unplanned Medical Expenses Savings
          5. Other Needs (Can be combined in one category, or separated into another category not yet mentioned)
          6. Subscriptions, Entertainment, Dining Out, Other Wants
            a. Side note to notice how number six includes expenses that can be cut if needed, and therefore, at the bottom of the list.
    
        Fifth, FOLLOW THE PLAN. Hold yourself accountable.
        Expense Track - It's tedious, but it keeps you aware of what your spending money on!
        This can be done immediately after a transaction, during a daily review, or even weekly review. HOWEVER, it shouldn't be less frequent than weekly or else it loses it's effect on awareness.
        This can also keep you from overspending when you notice how much money is going away.
        Have an accountability partner - sharing this plan with your significant other can not only keep you accountable but help strengthen the relationship.
        Personal Note: People have varying views on what finances to share with a partner. I have found that a relationship can be at it's strongest when we know of each others expenses. My wife and I share all of our expenses together as we review our budget weekly. DON'T NITPICK THOUGH! This can lead to your partner wanting to do things in secret possibly.

      When you first open the Budget Sheet, you will open to this tab called "Dashboard". This contains a summarization of a few things:
	      1. Select Period: You can select the month, quarter, or the entire year for review.
	      2. Bill/Subscription Tracker: You can keep track of all your monthly obligations, price, date it's due, and check off if it's been paid yet.
	      3. Actual Expenses: The category name, the amount spent in that category, the percentage of how much of your budgeted goal you've spent so far, and a progress bar to visualize that percentage.
	      4. Budgeted Expenses: This shows the category name, the amount you've budgeted for that category, and a displays a pie chart to show the percentage of how much each category takes from your income.
		      a. Note: When you haven't set a budget for the selected period you will see a red bar reminding you to set the budget before you can see the pie chart.
	      5. Income to Expense Comparison Table: When you enter your income it will show a blue bar on the right. Then, as you enter expenses, a red bar will slowly rise on the right side. The goal is to NEVER have that red bar exceed the blue bar.
		      a. Directly below the table you can see the dollar amount of how much income and expenses you have accumulated.
          b. Under that you will see options to adjust how the red bar is displayed. For example, if you want to see how much money you ACTUALLY spent (not including money you put in savings or towards investments), then you can select those options.

      Note: On Microsoft Excel, the Bill/Subscription box looks different because they do not have a checkbox feature. An easy work around is just to type the word "yes" to keep track of that.

      Likewise, due to the lack of checkboxes you will have to type "True" or "False" to correctly trigger the functions that display the adjustments on the red bar. TRUE means that the checkbox would be marked. FALSE means that the checkbox would be unmarked.

      The Transaction History tab is where you do the expense tracking. Here, you can keep track of all of your expenses. For a detailed record, you can include the date, name of the item purchase, the category it falls under, additional information (if applicable), and the cost. Inputting the information here will help translate to the Dashboard tab for a nice visual summary of your spending.

      The categories are the same categories mentioned in the "Creating A Budget" section of this website!
        Note: When you want to place some money into a savings goal use the "Savings Credit" option. When you withdraw money from a savings goal use the "Savings Debit" option.
        Note: I did not include any categories such as "dining out" or "movies" because I categorized them all under "Entertainment".

      When you select a category it will display a color on the expense tab. This is very helpful for quickly finding information. For example, if your "Entertainment" category was higher than expected, then you can quickly scan for yellow tabs and remind yourself what you purchased that month. This is great way to make plan to meet your goals the following month.

      The additional information is really meant for the "Income", "Savings Credit", and "Savings Debit" categories.
      The income category is strictly informational. It's a good way to keep track of different types of income.
      The savings credit and debit categories are essential. You need to tell the Budget Sheet which savings goal to move money in/out from.
      
      The Savings Goal tab of the sheet is where you can keep track of -  you guessed it - your savings goals! I decided to set a limit of 8 goals. I believe that if you have more, then you're possibly stretching your money thin and won't hit ANY of your goals.
      Here is where you get to input your goals. The top section called Goals is where you can create a name for your goal in the spot where it says "Empty Savings Goal" and set a dollar amount right under the name.

      The way to track money placed in a savings goal is to input it as a "Savings Credit" in the Transaction History tab.

      Once you have goals set and place some money into the account you will be able to see a progress chart on the right!

      The Budget tab is where you get to create your budget for the month. You add the budgeted income and expenses. The "total budgeted expenses" should match the budgeted income you enter. If that number is higher, then you need to subtract some expenses. If that number is lower, then I suggest you place the remainder into investments or savings. Every single dollar needs to have a job! Even if you decide to go ahead and place it into the entertainment category. A jobless dollar is a lost dollar.

      Here's an example of a completed monthly budget.

      The Data tab is where all of the magic happens. You can just ignore this tab. Messing around with any of the functions in this tab could skew data and cause errors in the functionality of the rest of the Budget Sheet!

      Let's check out an example of using the budget sheet. We are going to use the same budget as the example provided earlier. Data has been placed into the Transaction History. Remember how I said to try and use money earned from the previous month as income for the current month? This helps give a definitive income amount, so I did that in this example.

      You can see the Dashboard is starting to fill in now that we have a budget and expenses. See the Income to Expense Comparison Chart?

      Check out the Expense Comparison Chart now. I decided to exclude any money put into investments to see how much money actually left my pocket.
