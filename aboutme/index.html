        <p>Hello friends!</p>
        <p>I am a Computer Information Technology Major hoping to focus in on cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>I love music. I play the saxophone and guitar. I also love to go hiking and white water rafting.</p>
        <p>I have been happily married for two years and have an amazing 14-month old daughter.</p>
        <p>My aspiration is to go into the Air Force work in Cyber.</p>
        <p>Although I don't see much application in web design for my current goal, I know for a fact that I will enjoy the creative process of creating a website. I will most definitely take the knowledge of HTML with me!</p>
        <p>I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints when I was 16 and was able to serve a mission three years later at the age of 19. Joining the Church changed my life for the better. I have a firm testimony in my Savior, Jesus Christ, and in His restored gospel. My favorite scripture is actually Alma 26:16 where Ammon rejoices in the Lord to his brethren.</p>
