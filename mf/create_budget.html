            <h2>Important Note</h2>
            <p>My number one personal revelation when it comes to personal finances: If you're low on money, there's only two options - Increase Income or Decrease Expenses</p>
        </div>
        <!-- This section includes the steps to creating a budget. -->
        <h2 id = "create-budget-header">Create a Budget</h2>
        <section class = "create-budget">
            <h3 class="create-budget-step-header">STEP ONE</h3>
            <p>Define what your income is.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My personal tip: A lot of people will estimate what their income will be at the beginning of the month and budget accordingly, however that's just an estimate. When I budget, I want to know exact dollar amounts. Here's what you should do instead -- plan your budget according to the income you earned in the previous month.</li>
                <li>Note: This takes some planning in advance because if you need your income from that month to cover current expense, then the first big move is to SAVE SAVE SAVE!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="create-budget-step-header">STEP TWO</h3>
            <p>Subtract all fixed expenses from income: mortgage/rent, PMI/renters insurance, health insurance, vehicle payments, car insurance, phone bill, and utilities (electricity, water, gas, sewer, internet, trash collection). Side note: I would consider cable tv more as a subscription versus a necessary bill.</p>
            <h3 class="create-budget-step-header">STEP THREE</h3>
            <p>Invest in yourself. Put money into savings and investments.</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Deductibles: The Money Guy show teaches to make sure your deductibles are covered first and foremost. This includes health insurance, car insurance, and home insurance. If something major happens, then you can rest assured that you can cover the maximum of what you'll need to pay.</li>
                <li>Savings: Besides deductibles, it's also good to have an emergency fund. Generally, this is going to be about 3-6 months of income. However, another rule of thumb is to have enough months of savings based on how quickly you think you'd be able to find a new job.</li>
                <li>Savings: Consider saving up for that new car versus getting yourself into debt! Especially if you have reliable transportation already. Think of it as pre-paying yourself until you can afford to buy a car in full.</li>
                <li>Investment: I'm not going to get myself in trouble here by sharing investment strategies while not having the expertise, but what I CAN do is refer you to one of the three references made above. I wholeheartedly support all of these guys!</li>
                <li>NOTE: Sometimes, if money is tight, then obviously skip this step and proceed to the fourth step. Whatever money can be saved after step four should be placed back into investing in yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="create-budget-step-header">STEP FOUR</h3>
            <p>With the remaining amount, allocate the rest of your funds into the following categories, normally in this order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="numbered-list">Tithing (for those religious folk out there, including myself!)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a faithful Christian I have been blessed by paying my tithing! I'm so happy to support those around my community and around the world as I trust church leaders to apply that money to benefitting those who need help. Click <a class="tithing" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/tithing?lang=eng">here</a> to learn more about tithing!</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="numbered-list">Groceries</li>
                <li class="numbered-list">Gas/Travel Expenses</li>
                <li class="numbered-list">Unplanned Medical Expenses Savings</li>
                <li class="numbered-list">Other Needs (Can be combined in one category, or separated into another category not yet mentioned)</li>
                <li class="numbered-list">Subscriptions, Entertainment, Dining Out, Other Wants</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Side note to notice how number six includes expenses that can be cut if needed, and therefore, at the bottom of the list.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="create-budget-step-header">STEP FIVE</h3>
            <p>FOLLOW THE PLAN. Hold yourself accountable.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expense Track - It's tedious, but it keeps you aware of what your spending money on! This can be done immediately after a transaction, during a daily review, or even weekly review. HOWEVER, it shouldn't be less frequent than weekly or else it loses it's effect on awareness. This can also keep you from overspending when you notice how much money is leaving your pocket.</li>
                <li>Have an accountability partner - sharing this plan with your significant other can not only keep you accountable but help strengthen the relationship.</li>
                <li>Personal Note: People have varying views on what finances to share with a partner. I have found that a relationship can be at it's strongest when we know of each others expenses. My wife and I share all of our expenses together as we review our budget weekly. DON'T NITPICK THOUGH! This can lead to your partner wanting to do things in secret possibly.</li>
            </ul>
